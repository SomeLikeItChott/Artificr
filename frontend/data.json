[" \r\n\r\n                  ACESULFAME-POTASSIUM\r\n\r\n                  Artificial sweetener: \"Diet,\" \"no sugar added,\" \"sugar-free,\" and other products, including soft drinks, drink mixes, baked goods, gelatin desserts, frozen desserts, yogurt, candy, chewing gum, packaged (tabletop) sweeteners.\r\n\r\n                  Artificial sweetener\r\n\r\n                  This artificial sweetener is widely used around the world. It is about 200 times sweeter than sugar. In the United States, for several years acesulfame-K (also called ace-K; the K is the chemical symbol for potassium) was permitted only in foods like sugar-free baked goods, chewing gum, and gelatin desserts. In July 1998, the FDA allowed this chemical in soft drinks, thereby greatly increasing its use and consumer exposure. It is often used together with sucralose or aspartame.\r\n\r\n                  The safety tests of ace-K were conducted in the 1970s and were of mediocre quality. Key rat tests used animals afflicted by disease; a mouse study was several months too brief and did not expose animals during gestation. Two rat studies suggested that the additive might cause cancer. It was for those reasons that in 1996 the Center for Science in the Public Interest urged the FDA to require better testing before permitting ace-K in soft drinks. In addition, large doses of acetoacetamide, a breakdown product of ace-K, have been shown to affect the thyroid in rats, rabbits, and dogs. FDA should require manufacturers to conduct high-quality, modern-day studies of acesulfame-potassium or withdraw its approval of it.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  ACETIC ACID\r\n\r\n                  Preservative, flavoring, or acidulant.\r\n\r\n                  Preservative, flavoring, or acidulant\r\n\r\n                  Acetic acid is the chemical that gives vinegar its sharp taste and odor.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  ADIPIC ACID\r\n\r\n                  Acid, flavoring agent, antioxidant: soft drinks, fruit-flavored drinks, edible oils, gelatin desserts.\r\n\r\n                  Acid, flavoring agent, antioxidant\r\n\r\n                  Adipic acid is sometimes used as the acid in bottled drinks and throat lozenges.  Because it has little tendency to pick up moisture, adipic acid may be used to supply tartness, and it may account for the je ne sais quoi taste of highly manufactured powdered products, such as gelatin desserts and fruit flavored drinks.  It is occasionally added to edible oils to prevent them from going rancid.  Rats, and presumably humans, metabolize adipic acid without any difficulty.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  ADVANTAME\r\n\r\n                  Artificial sweetener: \"Diet,\" \"no sugar added,\" \"sugar-free,\" and other products.\r\n\r\n                  Artificial sweetener\r\n\r\n                  Advantame is the newest and sweetest artificial sweetener. An incredible 20,000 times sweeter than sucrose, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2014. It is permitted to be used in soft drinks, baked goods, chewing gum, confections and frostings, frozen desserts, gelatins and puddings, jams and jellies, processed fruits and fruit juices, toppings, and syrups. It is made from aspartame and vanillin, but appears to be processed by the body differently from aspartame.\r\n                  Two key safety studies on advantame were flawed. Nevertheless, because the additive is so incredibly sweet, the amounts that will be added to foods are so minuscule that they are almost certainly safe. For example, in the cancer study in mice, the number of animals that survived to the end of the study was below FDA's own recommendations. An FDA statistician concluded that the low survival rate \"probably masked the occurrence of late developing tumors.\" As for the cancer study in rats, some FDA scientists \"strongly objected\" to certain aspects because they \"may have compromised and confounded the outcome of the results.\" CSPI criticized the FDA's failure to abide by its own published standards and its dismissal of concerns raised by some of its own scientists.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  AIR\r\n\r\n                  Snack foods, ice cream, breakfast cereals\r\n\r\n                  Air is by far the cheapest food additive, and perfectly safe.  Extruded snack foods such as Cheetos, breakfast cereals like Kix, and inexpensive ice creams are fluffed out with air.  In the ice cream world, the amount of air whipped into the final product is called overrun.  Ben & Jerry's and Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice creams weigh more than 100 grams per half cup (120 grams), so they contain roughly 20% air.  Breyers vanilla ice cream weighs 67 grams per half cup, with about 45% of the volume being air.  That's one reason why the premium ice creams are higher in calories—they contain more actual ice cream per serving—and why the cheaper (and lower-calorie) ice creams are, well, cheaper.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  ALGINATE, PROPYLENE GLYCOL ALGINATE\r\n\r\n                  Thickening agents, foam stabilizer: Ice cream, cheese, candy, yogurt, beer.\r\n\r\n                  Thickening agents, foam stabilizer\r\n\r\n                  Alginate, an apparently safe derivative of seaweed (kelp), maintains the desired texture in dairy products, canned frosting, and other factory-made foods. Propylene glycol alginate, a chemically-modified algin, thickens acidic foods (soda pop, salad dressing) and can stabilize the foam in beer.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  ALOE VERA\r\n\r\n                  Beverages, yogurt, desserts, flavoring.\r\n\r\n                  Extract\r\n\r\n                  Aloe vera, which comes from a succulent plant, is sold as a juice and is added to various other foods and supplements. It is also marketed in various skin care products, for example to treat wounds and burns.  Companies make diverse health claims, but scientific evidence is scarce.  The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health concluded that aloe vera \"may\" help heal burns and abrasions (when used topically), but there is not enough evidence to support other claims.  Aloe vera taken orally can cause diarrhea and cramps and is recognized by FDA as a laxative. However, in 2002 FDA banned it from over-the-counter laxatives due to a lack of safety information.  \r\nCarefully conducted studies by the U.S. government concluded that there was \"clear\" evidence that aloe vera extracts caused intestinal cancers in male and female rats, but not mice.  The form tested, called non-decolorized whole-leaf extract of aloe vera, contains more of the components that are suspected of being cancer-causing—aloin and other anthraquinones—than do some aloe vera products on the market.  (The outer leaf pulp of aloe leaves, known as the latex, contains anthraquinones).  However, it is not known for sure what components of aloe vera are responsible for the tumors.\r\nThe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine also notes several other possible concerns: (1)  people with diabetes who use glucose-lowering medication should be cautious about taking aloe vera by mouth since preliminary studies suggest it may lower blood glucose levels; (2) there have been a few case reports of acute hepatitis following oral aloe vera use, but a cause-effect relationship has not been established; and (3) the diarrhea caused by the laxative effect of oral aloe vera can decrease the absorption of many drugs.\r\nGiven the possible risks and unsubstantiated benefits, people should not consume aloe vera.  People who choose to consume it should at least look for products made with a charcoal filtration process to decolorize and remove anthraquinones, and monitored to ensure than aloin levels are low (e.g., 1 part per million or less).  Some solid or semi-solid products have much higher levels of aloin.  However, low levels of aloin do not guarantee safety, since it is not known for sure exactly which components of aloe vera triggered cancers in rats.\r\n\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  ALPHA TOCOPHEROL (Vitamin E) \r\n\r\n                  Antioxidant, nutrient: Vegetable oils, breakfast cereals, beverages.\r\n\r\n                  Antioxidant, nutrient\r\n\r\n                  Vitamin E is abundant in whole wheat, rice germ, and vegetable oils.

Bakers add amylase to bread dough to supplement the small amount found naturally in wheat flour.  The sugar that the amylases produce serves as food for the fermenting yeast and also makes for better-tasting, better-toasting bread.  Amylases also improve the dough's consistency and the bread's keeping quality. \r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  ANNATTO\r\n\r\n                  Natural coloring: butter, cheese, other foods.\r\n\r\n                  Natural coloring\r\n\r\n                   Annatto is a widely used food coloring obtained from the seeds of a tropical shrub.  Its hue is yellow to orange.  Unfortunately, natural does not always mean perfectly safe.  Annatto causes hives in some people.  In fact, allergic reactions to annatto appear to be more common than reactions to commonly used synthetic food dyes.\r\n\r\n                ","\r\n\r\n                  ARTIFICIAL COLORINGS\r\n\r\n                  Most artificially colored foods are colored with synthetic chemicals that do not occur in nature. Because colorings are used almost solely in foods of low nutritional value (candy, soda pop, gelatin desserts, etc.), you should simply avoid all artificially colored foods.

That's unfortunate, because some people may be sensitive to certain flavoring ingredients, such as MSG or HVP.\r\n\r\n                 \r\n\r\n              ","\r\n\r\n                ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS and other SUGAR-FREE SWEETENERS\r\n\r\n                See also: Acesulfame-potassium, Aspartame, Brazzein, Cyclamate, Monatin, Monk Fruit, Neotame, Saccharin, Stevia Leaf Extract (Rebiana), Sucralose, Sugar Alcohols (Erythritol, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Isomalt, Lacitol, Maltitol, Mannitol, Sorbitol, Xylitol), Thaumatin\r\n\r\n                Artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes are used in a wide range of foods to provide sweetness without or with fewer calories.  The question is: are they safe?  Controversies have swirled around most of the artificial sweeteners. Acesulfame-potassium, aspartame, and saccharin, and possibly also sucralose, may pose a slight risk of cancer.  The artificial sweetener neotame and the natural \"high-potency\" sweeteners rebiana and thaumatin appear to be safe.  But research on all of them is relatively limited.  For instance, a 2010 study found that artificially sweetened drinks probably caused preterm deliveries; the researchers suspected that aspartame was the culprit.  Synthetic high-potency sweeteners were the rule until about 2009 when rebiana, which is purified out of stevia leaves, became marketed widely in the United States.  Rebiana, which has \"taste challenges,\" allowed companies to claim \"all natural\" on their artificially sweetened (with a \"natural ingredient,\" that is) products.\r\nSugar alcohols are sugar-free (and alcohol-free) sweeteners.  Some occur in plants, but are typically manufactured.  Most have about half as many calories as sugar, though erythritol has one-twentieth as many.  They appear to be safe, except that large amounts of most of them may have a laxative effect (erythritol does not cause diarrhea, but may cause nausea).\r\nCompanies advertise their artificially sweetened foods as being almost magical weight-loss potions.  The fact is, though, that losing weight is difficult, and people need to make a real concerted effort to eat fewer calories and exercise more.  Artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes can make the struggle a little more pleasant. \r\n\r\n\r\n              "," \r\n\r\n                ASCORBIC ACID (Vitamin C) \r\n\r\n                Antioxidant, nutrient, color stabilizer: Cereals, fruit drinks, cured meats.\r\n\r\n                Antioxidant, nutrient, color stabilizer\r\n\r\n                Ascorbic acid—or vitamin C—helps maintain the red color of cured meat and prevents the formation of nitrosamines, which promote cancer (see SODIUM NITRITE).

Though palmitate from palm and other vegetable oils can increase blood cholesterol levels, the amount derived from this additive is trivial.\r\n\r\n              ","\r\n\r\n                 ASPARTAME \r\n\r\n                Artificial sweetener: \"Diet,\" \"no sugar added,\" \"sugar-free,\" and other products, including soft drinks, drink mixes, gelatin desserts, frozen desserts, jams and fruit spreads, yogurt, breakfast cereal, candy, chewing gum, condiments, packaged (tabletop) sweeteners.\r\n\r\n                Artificial sweetener\r\n\r\n                Aspartame (sometimes marketed under the brand names Equal, NutraSweet, or AminoSweet) is a chemical combination of two amino acids and methanol. Questions of cancer and neurological problems, such as dizziness or hallucinations, have swirled around aspartame for decades. A key 1970s industry-sponsored study initially sparked concerns that aspartame caused brain tumors in rats, but the FDA convinced an independent review panel to reverse its conclusion that aspartame was unsafe. The agency then approved its use in 1981 for use as a tabletop (packaged) sweetener and in breakfast cereals, powdered beverage mixes, and other dry packaged foods. Two years later FDA approved aspartame for use in soft drinks, by far the biggest and most lucrative market.  Aspartame dominates the diet soft drink market, and the overall market for artificial sweetener, although its use is declining.\r\n\r\nThe California Environmental Protection Agency and others have urged that independent scientists conduct new animal studies to resolve the cancer question. In 2005, researchers at the Ramazzini Foundation in Bologna, Italy, conducted the first such study. The study found that rats exposed to aspartame starting at eight weeks of age and continuing through their entire lifetimes developed lymphomas, leukemias, and other tumors, including kidney tumors, which are extremely rare in the strain of rat used. In 2007, the same researchers published a follow-up study that exposed rats to aspartame beginning in the womb and continuing through their entire lifetimes. That study, too, found that aspartame caused leukemias/lymphomas, as well as mammary (breast) cancer. Then in 2010, they published a study on aspartame in mice, also exposing the animals starting in the womb and continuing throughout their entire lifetimes. That third study found that aspartame caused liver and lung cancer in male mice.\r\n\r\nThose new studies may have found problems that earlier company-sponsored studies did not because the newer studies used far more animals and thus were more capable of detecting adverse effects. Also, the Italian researchers monitored the animals for their entire lifetimes: as long as three years for the rats and two and one-half years for the mice, instead of just two years in the company-sponsored studies (Most chemicals are tested for just two years.) Two-year-old rats are roughly equivalent to 65-year-old people. The many tumors that occurred after two years would never have been seen in industry’s studies. Furthermore, two of the new studies included exposure before birth, which increased their ability to detect cancer (only one of the industry studies did).\r\n\r\nThe food industry and the European Food Safety Authority contest the Italian findings, pointing to what they consider serious flaws in the design and conduct of the study and evaluation of the results. However, scientists at the Center for Science in the Public Interest and elsewhere, citing evaluations sponsored by the U.S. National Toxicology Program and the Environmental Protection Agency, found industry's and EFSA’s allegations to have little merit.\r\n\r\nAs one defense of aspartame, industry and FDA point to a 2006 human study by U.S. National Cancer Institute researchers. That study involved a large number of adults 50 to 71 years of age over a five-year period.  The study did not find any evidence that aspartame posed a risk. However, the NCI study had three major limitations: It did not involve truly elderly people (the Italian studies monitored rodents until they died a natural death), the subjects had not consumed very much aspartame or for very long, and it was not a well-controlled study (the subjects provided only a rough estimate of their aspartame consumption, and people who consumed aspartame might have had other dietary or lifestyle differences that obscured the chemical’s effects).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the most careful long-term study of aspartame in humans, conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, found the first human evidence that aspartame poses a slightly increased cancer risk to men, but not women. The researchers speculated that that might be due to the fact that men have higher levels of an enzyme that converts methanol (a breakdown product of aspartame) to formaldehyde, a human carcinogen. The Harvard study couldn't prove that aspartame was a carcinogen, but it certainly added to the safety concerns, especially since the cancers observed in the human study (multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) were similar to the cancers observed in two of the three animal studies (leukemias and lymphomas).\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that three independent studies have found that consumption of aspartame causes cancer in rodents, and one epidemiology study found evidence that aspartame increases the risk of cancer in men. That should be reason enough for the FDA and other governments to eliminate aspartame from the food supply. Meanwhile, consumers should read labels carefully and avoid this artificial sweetener).\r\n\r\nAnother concern about aspartame emerged in 2010, when Danish researchers linked the consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks, but not sugar-sweetened soft drinks, to preterm delivery of babies. In 2012 another study, this time conducted in Norway, corroborated that finding. However, it also found a link between sugar-sweetened beverages and preterm delivery.  Though the studies couldn’t distinguish between the various artificial sweeteners, aspartame and acesulfame-potassium were the most widely used ones in those countries. The fact that two large, independent studies found a link between artificially sweetened beverages and preterm delivery is troubling. Pregnant women should make a special effort to avoid or at least cut back on aspartame and acesulfame-K, as well as moderating their consumption of added sugars.\r\n\r\nSince aspartame was first used, some people have contended that it causes headaches or dizziness. Some small studies have documented that finding, while others did not. Anyone experiencing such problems should simply avoid aspartame.\r\n\r\n              "," \r\n\r\n                  \r\n                  AZODICARBONAMIDE\r\n\r\n                  Flour improver and bleaching agent: White flour, bread and rolls.\r\n\r\n                  Flour improver and bleaching agent\r\n\r\n                  Azodicarbonamide (ADC) has long been used by commercial bakers to strengthen dough, but has been poorly tested.  A 1999 review published by several United Nations agencies concluded that \"There are no adequate data relating to carcinogenic, reproductive, or developmental effects, hence it is not possible to evaluate the risk to human health for these endpoints.\" \r\n \r\nMost of the concern about ADC relates to two suspicious chemicals that form when bread is baked.  The first chemical is semicarbazide (SEM), which caused cancers of the lung and blood vessels in mice.  It did not cause cancer in rats.  In 1976 the International Agency for Research on Cancer considered SEM to be a carcinogen in mice, but in 1987 concluded that the animal data were \"limited\" and that SEM was \"not classifiable\" as to its carcinogenicity to humans.\r\n\r\nA second breakdown product, urethane, is a recognized carcinogen.  ADC used at its maximum allowable level (45 ppm in bread) leads to levels of urethane in bread that pose a small risk to humans.  Toasting that bread increases the amount of urethane.  However, when used at 20 ppm, which may be the amount used by some commercial bakeries, a 1997 FDA study found \"only a slight increase\" in urethane.  (Some urethane forms in bread not made with azodicarbonamide.)\r\n\r\nConsidering that many breads don't contain azodicarbonamide and that its use slightly increases exposure to a carcinogen, this is hardly a chemical that we need in our food supply.  It appears that the Delaney amendment, which bars the use of additives that cause cancer in humans or animals, would require FDA to bar its use.  At the very least, FDA should reduce the amount allowed to be used.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  BENZOIC ACID\r\n\r\n                  See SODIUM BENZOATE\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  BETA-CAROTENE\r\n\r\n                  Coloring, nutrient: Margarine, shortening, non-dairy whiteners, beverages, breakfast cereals, supplements.\r\n\r\n                  Coloring, nutrient\r\n\r\n                  Beta-carotene is used as an artificial coloring and a nutrient supplement.

Brazzein is a small (54 amino acids) protein molecule that occurs naturally in the berries of a climbing vine found in West Africa, where it has been consumed by people and animals. It is about 1,000 times sweeter than sugar, but, as far as we can determine, it has not been tested for safety. Because it is a protein, it might cause food allergies.

In 1970, FDA permitted its use only an \"interim\" basis pending additional study—one of only four such interim-allowed additives.  Decades later, BVO is still poorly tested and remains on the interim list.\r\n\r\nHealth concerns start with the finding that eating BVO leaves residues in body fat and the fat in brain, liver, and other organs.  Animal studies indicate that BVO is transferred from mother's milk to the nursing infant and also can cause heart lesions, fatty changes in the liver, and impaired growth and behavioral development.  Those studies suggest that BVO might be harmful to people who drink large amounts of soft drinks that contain BVO.  Indeed, doctors have identified bromine toxicity in two people who drank extremely large amounts of such sodas.  Sensitive, modern studies are urgently needed to better understand the risk, especially at the lower levels typically consumed by large numbers of children.  Meanwhile, BVO should not be used (it is not permitted in Europe).\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  BUTYLATED HYDROXYANISOLE (BHA)\r\n\r\n                  Antioxidant: Cereals, chewing gum, potato chips, vegetable oil.\r\n\r\n                  Antioxidant\r\n\r\n                  BHA retards rancidity in fats, oils, and oil-containing foods.

Those cancers are controversial because they occur in the forestomach, an organ that humans do not have.  However, a chemical that causes cancer in at least one organ in three different species indicates that it might be carcinogenic in humans.  That is why the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services considers BHA to be \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.\" Nevertheless, the Food and Drug Administration still permits BHA to be used in foods. This synthetic chemical can be replaced by safer chemicals (e.g., vitamin E), safer processes (e.g., packing foods under nitrogen instead of air), or can simply be left out (many brands of oily foods, such as potato chips, don't use any antioxidant).\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  BUTYLATED HYDROXYTOLUENE (BHT)\r\n\r\n                  Antioxidant: Cereals, chewing gum, potato chips, oils, etc.\r\n\r\n                  Antioxidant\r\n\r\n                  BHT retards rancidity in oils.

Many coffee drinkers experience withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches, irritability, sleepiness, and lethargy, when they stop drinking coffee. \r\n\r\n                  Because caffeine increases the risk of miscarriages (and possibly birth defects) and inhibits fetal growth, it should be avoided by women who are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant. It also may make it harder to get pregnant. \r\n\r\n                  Caffeine also keeps many people from sleeping, causes jitteriness, and affects calcium metabolism.  However, on the positive side, drinking a couple of mugs cups per day of regular (but not decaf) coffee appears to reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, gallstones, and even suicide. It also can relieve headache pain, increase endurance, such as on a treadmill, and improve alertness.\r\n\r\n                  The caffeine in a standard cup or two of coffee is harmless to most people. But be aware that a middle-size (16 oz.) cup of regular coffee at popular coffeehouses contains 300 or more milligrams of caffeine.  That is equivalent to three old-fashioned 5-ounce-cups' worth of caffeine. A 12-oz. can of Coca-Cola or most other caffeinated soft drinks contains about 35 to 40 milligrams; energy drinks typically contain much more.

Caramel coloring may be used to simulate the appearance of cocoa in baked goods, make meats and gravies look more attractive, and darken soft drinks and beer.\r\n\r\n                   Caramel coloring, when produced with ammonia, contains contaminants, 2-methylimidazole and 4-methylimidazole. In 2007, studies by the U.S. National Toxicology Program found that those two contaminants cause cancer in male and female mice and possibly in female rats. In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a division of the World Health Organization, concluded that 2- and 4-methylimidazole are \"possibly carcinogenic to humans.\" Then, the State of California's Environmental Protection Agency listed ammonia-caramel coloring as a carcinogen under the state's Proposition 65. The state lists chemicals when they pose a lifetime risk of at least 1 cancer per 100,000 people. California warned that as of January 7, 2012, widely consumed products, such as soft drinks, that contained more than 29 micrograms of 4-methylimidazole per serving would have to bear a warning notice. In March 2012, when CSPI published the results of a study that found levels up to 150 micrograms per can of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola purchased in Washington, DC, the soft-drink giants announced that they had reduced the contaminant to below California's threshold for action in products distributed in California. They said they would market the less-contaminated products throughout the country, but did not give a timetable for that change.\r\n\r\n                  The FDA has a limit that is 10 times as strict as California's for regulating chemicals that are contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals. CSPI's analysis of a Coca-Cola purchased in 2012 in California found just 4 micrograms of 4-MI per 12 ounces.  Even that much lower level might exceed the FDA's threshold for action of 1 cancer per million consumers.\r\n\r\n                  It would be worth avoiding or drinking less colas and other ammonia-caramel-colored beverages not only because of risk from the 4-methylimidazole, but, of course, because the products contain about 10 teaspoons of sugar per 12 ounces and promote obesity and tooth decay.

The FDA rejected  CSPI's request for labels to disclose that carmine is extracted from insects so  vegetarians and others who want to avoid animal products could do so. \r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  CARRAGEENAN\r\n\r\n                  Thickening, gelling, and stabilizing agent: Ice cream, sorbet, jelly, chocolate milk, infant formula, cottage cheese, whipping cream, salad dressings, tofu.\r\n\r\n                  Thickening, gelling, stabilizing agent\r\n\r\n                Carrageenan is a family of indigestible large molecules obtained from certain seaweeds.  It is used as a thickening or texturing agent in a wide variety of foods and beverages.\r\nLarge amounts of carrageenan have harmed test animals' colons, but the amounts in food are too small to be a concern for most people.  An independent committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded, though, that it is unclear whether people with episodes of gastrointestinal disease might absorb some carrageenan, which presumably could cause gastrointestinal or immune-system problems.  Some people report that their gastrointestinal symptoms diminished after eliminating carrageenan from their diet.\r\nCarrageenan--at least in its natural, undegraded form--does not cause cancer in animals.  However, there has been controversy over whether natural carrageenan—especially at the low levels relevant to consumers—increases the potency of chemicals that do cause cancer.  The FDA and the WHO committee have both reviewed concluded that food-grade carrageenan does not pose a direct or indirect cancer risk.  \r\nAlso, food-grade carrageenan contains some “degraded” carrageenan, and a bit more degrades in the acidic conditions of the stomach.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer, another unit of the WHO, considers degraded carrageenan to be “possibly carcinogenic in humans.”  While any possible cancer risk is likely to be small (or non-existent), some people may wish to err on the side of great caution and avoid carrageenan. \r\nSome experts have been concerned about the safety of carrageenan for infants, given that the GI tract of the infant is still developing.  In 2014, however, the WHO committee reviewed new animal studies and concluded that infant formula made with carrageenan is safe. \r\n\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  CASEIN, SODIUM CASEINATE\r\n\r\n                  Thickening and whitening agent: Ice cream, ice milk, sherbet, coffee creamers.\r\n\r\n                  Thickening/whitening agent\r\n\r\n                  Casein, the principal protein in milk, is a nutritious protein\r\n\r\n                    containing adequate amounts of all the essential amino acids.

The food industry finds it strong, tar-like, musky odor to be useful in flavorings.

Widespread publicity around 2005 to 2007 and several lawsuits persuaded most major American food manufacturers to protect their workers (and restaurant cooks) by switching to supposedly safer ingredients. But more recent studies indicate that one substitute, 2,3-pentanedione, chemically similar to diacetyl (also called  2,3-butanedione), may be just as damaging to the respiratory tract.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  DIACYLGLYCEROL\r\n\r\n                  Cooking oil.\r\n\r\n                  Cooking oil\r\n\r\n                  This is the diglyceride part of the long-used emulsifier, mono- and diglycerides.

Small amounts occur naturally in such fruits as pears, melons, and grapes, but virtually all of the erythritol used as a food additive is produced by fermenting glucose with various yeasts. Many companies mix it with high-potency sweeteners, such as stevia leaf extract or monk fruit extract, to keep the calories down while masking those other sweeteners’ unpleasant aftertastes. Companies also value erythritol because it provides the bulk that sugar has and which high-potency sweeteners lack, plus it adds to the \"mouthfeel\" of low-sugar beverages. Because it is not digested by bacteria, it does not promote tooth decay.\r\n\r\nOther than occasional allergic reactions, the only safety concern about erythritol is that eating too much of it could cause nausea. Individual sensitivities vary greatly, but most adults can safely consume up to about 50 grams of erythritol per day. (For comparison, there are 12 grams in Blue Sky Zero Cola, 4 grams of erythritol in a 12-ounce can of Zevia soda. and 3 grams of erythritol in a packet of Truvia.) That's safer than most other sugar alcohols, such as sorbitol, mannitol, and lactitol. Erythritol's relative safety is due to its being mostly absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted unchanged in urine. Other sugar alcohols stir up trouble in the colon where they attract water (leading to laxation or diarrhea) or are digested by bacteria (causing gas).\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  FERROUS GLUCONATE\r\n\r\n                  Coloring, nutrient: Black olives.\r\n\r\n                  Coloring, nutrient \r\n\r\n                  Used by the olive industry to generate a uniform jet-black color\r\n\r\n                    and in pills as a source of iron.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  FOOD-STARCH, MODIFIED\r\n\r\n                  See STARCH, MODIFED\r\n\r\n                  Thickening agent\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  FRUCTOSE\r\n\r\n                  Sweetener: \"Health\" drinks and other products.\r\n\r\n                  Sweetener\r\n\r\n                  Fructose (also called levulose) is a sugar that is a little sweeter than table sugar. Modest amounts of fructose occur naturally in fruits and vegetables, which also contain other sugars. When table sugar is digested, it breaks down into equal amounts of fructose and glucose (dextrose). Another major source of fructose in the typical diet is high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which typically contains about half fructose and half glucose. Fructose itself is used as a sweetener in a small number of foods whose labels often imply, deceptively, that such foods are healthier than competing products that are sweetened with sugar or HFCS.\r\n\r\n                  The fructose that occurs in fruits and vegetables is certainly safe.  However, the large amounts that come from added fructose, sucrose (ordinary table sugar), and high-fructose corn syrup increase triglyceride (fat) and small, dense LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels in blood and may thereby increase the risk of heart disease.  Also, recent studies show that consuming 25 percent of one's calories from fructose or high-fructose corn syrup (which is about half fructose) leads to more visceral (deep belly) fat or liver fat.  Those changes may increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease.  Finally, large amounts consumed on a regular basis also may affect levels of such hormones as leptin and ghrelin, which help regulate appetite, thereby contributing to weight gain and obesity.\r\n\r\n                  The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (America's basic nutrition policy), American Heart Association, and other health authorities recommend that people consume no more than about 3 to 8 percent of calories in the form of refined sugars.  That's far less than the current average of 14 percent of calories.  The bottom line: the less added sugars—fructose, dextrose, sucrose, or HFCS—one consumes the better (though, again, small amounts are safe).\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  FUMARIC ACID\r\n\r\n                  Tartness agent: Powdered drinks, pudding, pie fillings, gelatin desserts.\r\n\r\n                  Tartness agent\r\n\r\n                  A solid at room temperature, inexpensive, and highly acidic, fumaric\r\n\r\n                    acid is the ideal source of tartness and acidity in dry food products.

It is not clear whether the gum itself, bacterial contamination of the gum, or some other cause is to blame.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  HELIUM\r\n\r\n                  Inert, safe gas: Balloons or pressurized containers.\r\n\r\n                  Inert, safe gas\r\n\r\n                  Helium is an inert, safe gas that is used to float balloons or sometimes to force foods out of pressurized containers.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  HEPTYL PARABEN\r\n\r\n                  Preservative: Beer, non-carbonated soft drinks.\r\n\r\n                  Preservative\r\n\r\n                  Heptyl paraben—short for the heptyl ester of\r\n\r\n                    para-hydroxybenzoic acid—is a preservative.

That's because this sweet syrupy liquid is cheaper and easier for some companies to use than sugar. HFCS has been blamed by a few people for the obesity epidemic, because rates of obesity have climbed right along with HFCS consumption. But that's an urban myth. HFCS and sugar are equally harmful. We're consuming way too much of both.\r\n\r\nHFCS starts out as cornstarch. Companies use enzymes or acids to break down most of the starch into its glucose subunits. Then other enzymes convert different proportions of the glucose to fructose. The resulting syrups contain as much as 90 percent fructose, but most HFCS is 42 percent or 55 percent fructose. In 2011, about 48 pounds of corn sweeteners, mostly HFCS, and 70 pounds cane and beet sugar were produced per capita in the United States. A total of 134 pounds of all caloric sweeteners, down 13 percent from the 1999 high of 154 pounds, was produced per person. And, because of all the criticism (not fully deserved) of HFCS in recent years, HFCS consumption declined by about 22 percent between 2002 and 2010.  Much of that historic decline resulted from declining soft drink consumption (thanks to increased health consciousness and to the popularity of bottled water). Actual consumption (as opposed to production) of caloric sweeteners, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was 79 pounds per person in 2011.\r\n\r\nSome people think that HFCS is mostly fructose, which probably plays a significant role in obesity. However, HFCS, on average, is about half fructose and half glucose—the same as ordinary table sugar (sucrose) when it is metabolized by the body. When sugar is (or, as is generally the case, was) used in soft drinks, much of it is broken down to glucose and fructose right in the bottle. \r\n\r\nSome people have contended that soft drinks made with HFCS are cheaper than if they were made with regular sugar. However, the extra cost would only be at most a penny or two per can, a difference that would have little effect on consumption.\r\n\r\nModest amounts of fructose from HFCS or other sources are safe and do not boost blood glucose levels, making the sweetener attractive to diabetics. However, large amounts promote tooth decay, as well as increase triglyceride (fat) levels in blood, thereby increasing the risk of heart disease. Also, recent studies show that consuming 25 percent of calories from fructose or HFCS leads to more visceral (deep belly) fat or liver fat. Those changes may increase the risk of diabetes or heart disease. Finally, large amounts of fructose consumed on a regular basis also may affect levels of such hormones as insulin, leptin, and ghrelin that regulate appetite, thereby contributing to weight gain and obesity. The HFCS 55 that is used in most soft drinks contains about 10 percent more fructose than sucrose. That makes most soft drinks a bit more harmful than if they were made with sugar.\r\n\r\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans (America's basic nutrition policy), American Heart Association, and other health authorities recommend that people consume no more than about 3 to 8 percent of calories in the form of refined sugars. That's far less than the current average of 15 percent of calories. The bottom line: the fewer added sugars—fructose, sucrose, or HFCS—one consumes the better (though, again, small amounts are safe).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  See also MALTODEXTRIN and HIGH MALTOSE CORN SYRUP .\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  HIGH-MALTOSE CORN SYRUP\r\n\r\n                  Sweetener, improves shelf life, inhibits bacterial growth, fermentation, other purposes: Candy, baked goods, beer.\r\n\r\n                  Sweetener\r\n\r\n                  Acids or enzymes are used to  break down cornstarch into a syrup rich in maltose (35 percent or more), a  disaccharide.  High-maltose corn syrup,  corn syrup solids, and maltodextrin are similar, and each are produced in a  wide variety of formulations for different applications.\r\n\r\n                  See also MALTODEXTRIN and HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  HYDROGENATED STARCH HYDROLYSATE (HSH)\r\n\r\n                  Sugar-free sweetener: Candy, chocolates, chewing gum, baked goods.\r\n\r\n                  Sweetener\r\n\r\n                  HSH, like sorbitol and other sugar alcohols, is slightly sweet and poorly absorbed by the body.

Also, foods such as Parmesan cheese and tomatoes contain glutamate that\r\n\r\n                    occurs naturally, but no reactions have been reported to those foods. \r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  MYCOPROTEIN\r\n\r\n                  Meat substitute: Quorn brand foods.\r\n\r\n                  Meat substitute\r\n\r\n                  Mycoprotein, the novel ingredient in Quorn-brand frozen meat substitutes, is made from processed mold (Fusarium venenatum), can cause serious and even fatal allergic reactions. Though the manufacturer's (Marlow Foods) advertising and labeling implied that the product is \"mushroom protein\" or \"mushroom in origin,\" the mold (or fungus) from which it is made does not produce mushrooms. Rather, the mold is grown in liquid solution in large tanks. It has been used in the United Kingdom since the 1990s and has also been sold in continental Europe. Quorn foods have been marketed in the United States since 2002 and in Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand more recently. The chunks of imitation meat are nutritious, but the prepared foods in which they are used may be high in fat or salt.\r\nSeveral percent of consumers are sensitive to Quorn products, resulting in vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and, less often, hives and potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions. Many people have gone to emergency rooms for treatment of Quorn-related reactions. In 2013, an 11-year-old boy who had asthma died after eating a Quorn Turk’y Burger. \r\nA survey in the United Kingdom sponsored by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) found that the percentage of consumers sensitive to Quorn is probably as great as, or greater than, the percentage sensitive to soy, milk, peanuts, and other common food allergens. The British and American governments acknowledge that people are allergic or intolerant to Quorn foods, but so far have rejected CSPI's recommendations to bar the use of mycoprotein or require Quorn foods to bear a label warning of possible severe adverse reactions. (In fact, when Quorn-containing \"vegetarian\" products are served at restaurants, cafeterias, and other foodservice locations, there is no label to inform consumers that they are eating Quorn foods.)\r\n\r\n                  Consumers who believe they have been sickened by Quorn foods may file an adverse-reaction report with the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  NATAMYCIN (PIMARCIN)\r\n\r\n                  Antimicrobial: Cheese.\r\n\r\n                  Antimicrobial\r\n\r\n                  This antimicrobial agent is produced by bacteria and used to prevent mold growth in cheese.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  NEOTAME\r\n\r\n                  Artificial sweetener: \"Diet,\" \"no-sugar added,\" \"sugar-free\" and other products, including soft drinks, dairy products, frozen desserts, and baked goods.\r\n\r\n                  Artificial sweetener\r\n\r\n                  Neotame (brand name Newtame), produced by NutraSweet Co., is a remarkable 8,000 times sweeter than table sugar and 40 times sweeter than aspartame.

Partial hydrogenation reduces the levels of polyunsaturated oils - and also creates trans fats, which promote heart disease. A committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded in 2004 that on a gram-for-gram basis, trans fat is even more harmful than saturated fat. Ideally, food manufacturers would replace hydrogenated shortening with less-harmful ingredients. The Institute of Medicine has advised consumers to consume as little trans fat as possible, ideally less than about 2 grams a day (that much might come from naturally occurring trans fat in beef and dairy products).  Harvard School of Public Health researchers estimate that trans fat had been causing about 50,000 premature heart attack deaths annually, making partially hydrogenated oil one of the most harmful ingredients in the food supply (see discussion of salt below). \r\n\r\n                  Beginning in 2006, Nutrition Facts labels have had to list the amount of trans fat in a serving. That spurred many companies, including Frito-Lay, Kraft, ConAgra, and others, to replace most or all of the partially hydrogenated oil in almost all their products. Usually the substitutes are healthier and the total of saturated plus trans fat is no higher than it was.  Foods labeled \"0g trans fat\" are permitted to contain 0.5g per serving, while \"no trans fat\" means none at all.  Consumers need to read labels carefully: foods labeled \"0g trans\" or \"no trans\" may still have large amounts of saturated fat. \r\n\r\n                  Restaurants, which do not provide nutrition information, have been slower to change, but the pace of change has picked up.  They use partially hydrogenated oil for frying chicken, potatoes, and fish, as well as in biscuits and other baked goods.  McDonald's, Wendy's, KFC, Taco Bell, Ruby Tuesday, and Red Lobster are some of the large chains that have largely eliminated trans fat or soon will.  Most large chains and many smaller independent restaurants continue to fry in partially hydrogenated oil and their French fries, fried chicken, fried fish, and pot pies contain substantial amounts of trans fat. Fortunately, the use of partially hydrogenated oil dropped by 50 percent from around 2000 to 2007. \r\n\r\n                  In Denmark, the government has virtually banned partially hydrogenated oil. In 2004, the Center for Science in the Public Interest petitioned the FDA to immediately require restaurants to disclose when they use partially hydrogenated oil and to begin the process of eliminating partially hydrogenated oil from the entire food supply.  While the FDA rejected the idea of requiring restaurants to disclose the presence of trans fat, New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, and other jurisdictions have set tight limits on the trans-fat content of restaurant foods.  Finally, in 2013 the FDA responded to CSPI's petition to revoke the legal status of partially hydrogenated oil (the FDA has considered that oil to be \"generally recognized as safe,\" even though it and everyone else considers it to be \"generally recognized as dangerous).\"  If the FDA follows through with its proposal, artificial trans fat will largely be eliminated from the U.S. food supply.  As of mid-2014, the FDA had not finalized its proposal.\r\n\r\n                  Fully hydrogenated vegetable oil does not have any trans fat, but it also does not have any polyunsaturated oils. It is sometimes mixed (physically or chemically) with polyunsaturated liquid soybean oil to create trans-free shortening. When it is chemically combined with liquid oil, the ingredient is called inter-esterified vegetable oil. Meanwhile, oil processors are trying to improve the hydrogenation process so that less trans fat forms. \r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  PECTIN (and SODIUM PECTINATE)\r\n\r\n                  Gelling agent: Jams, jellies.\r\n\r\n                  Gelling agent\r\n\r\n                  Pectin is a safe carbohydrate that strengthens cell walls in citrus fruits, apples, beets, carrots, and other fruits and vegetables.

That said, other animal and human studies did not identify a cancer risk.\r\n\r\n                  In 1977, the FDA proposed that saccharin be banned because of the studies showing that it causes cancer in animals. However, Congress intervened and permitted it to be used, provided that foods carried a warning notice. In 1997, the diet-food industry began pressuring the U.S. and Canadian governments and the World Health Organization to take saccharin off their lists of cancer-causing chemicals. The industry acknowledges that large amounts of saccharin cause bladder cancer in male rats, but argues that those tumors are caused by a mechanism that would not occur in humans.  Some public health experts respond by stating that, even if that still-unproved mechanism was correct in male rats, saccharin could cause cancer by additional mechanisms and that, in some studies, saccharin has caused bladder cancer in mice and in female rats and other cancers in both rats and mice. \r\n\r\n                  In May 2000, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services removed saccharin from its list of cancer-causing chemicals. Later that year, Congress passed a law removing the warning notice.\r\n                  Saccharin has been replaced in almost all foods by aspartame and other better-tasting sweeteners. Coca-Cola Company's Tab, one of the first diet sodas, still contains saccharin, but now also contains aspartame. In Canada, saccharin is allowed for sale in pharmacies and not allowed in packaged foods and beverages. However, in 2013 Health Canada proposed its intention to allow the much-debated sweetener to be used in processed foods and beverages.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SALATRIM\r\n\r\n                  Modified fat: Baked goods, candy.\r\n\r\n                  Modified fat\r\n\r\n                  This manufactured fat (developed by Nabisco) has the physical properties of regular fat, but the manufacturer claims it provides only about 5/9 as many calories. Its use can enable companies to make reduced-calorie claims on their products. Salatrim's low calorie content results from its content of stearic acid, which the manufacturer says is absorbed poorly, and short-chain fatty acids, which provide fewer calories per unit weight. \r\n\r\n                  Critics have charged that it does not provide as big a calorie reduction as claimed by Nabisco. Moreover, only very limited testing has been done to determine effects on humans. Eating small amounts of salatrim is probably safe, but large amounts (30g or more per day) increase the risk of such side effects as stomach cramps and nausea. No tests have been done to determine if the various food additives (salatrim, olestra, mannitol, and sorbitol) that cause gastrointestinal symptoms can act in concert to cause greater effects. \r\n\r\n                  Nabisco declared salatrim safe and has marketed it, as the law allows, without formal FDA approval.  (Nabisco has since sold salatrim to another company, Cultor.)  In June 1998, the Center for Science in the Public Interest urged the FDA to ban salatrim until better tests were done and demonstrated safety. The FDA rejected that recommendation, but salatrim is not widely used, if at all.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SALT (Sodium Chloride)\r\n\r\n                  Flavoring, preservative: Most processed foods, cured meats, soup, snack chips, crackers, and others.\r\n\r\n                  Flavoring, preservative\r\n\r\n                  Salt, at the levels present in the diets of most people around the world, is probably the single most harmful substance in the food supply.  Salt is used liberally in many processed foods and restaurant meals, with some meals containing far more than a day's worth of sodium. Other additives, such as monosodium glutamate and sodium benzoate, contribute additional sodium. Salt serves many purposes in foods, such as acting as a preservative, adding a salty flavor, masking bitter flavors, and fostering expected texture or other property. \r\n\r\n                  A diet high in sodium increases blood pressure in most people, thereby increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. In 2004, the director of the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and two colleagues estimated that cutting the amount of sodium in packaged and restaurant foods by half would save 150,000 lives a year. Everyone should avoid salty processed foods and restaurant meals, use salt sparingly in cooking and at the table, and enjoy other seasonings. \r\n\r\n                  The Food and Drug Administration considers salt to be \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS), even though it recognizes that diets high in salt are a major cause of cardiovascular disease and even though its own advisory committee in 1979 concluded that salt should not be considered GRAS. In 1978 and 2005 the Center for Science in the Public Interest petitioned the FDA to revoke salt's GRAS status and take other steps to lower sodium levels in the food supply. In response, the FDA held a public hearing in November, 2007. Meanwhile, the British government has made salt reduction one of its top health goals and has been having significant success. \r\n\r\n                  Many companies defend the amounts of salt used, saying that using less would sacrifice taste or safety.  However, comparisons of different brands of the same product frequently show wide differences in sodium content. That indicates that many companies could use less salt (or other sodium-containing ingredients) to the levels used by competitors and still have perfectly marketable products. \r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SILICON DIOXIDE, SILICA, CALCIUM SILICATE\r\n\r\n                  Anti-caking agent: salt, soups, coffee creamer, and other dry, powdery foods. \r\n\r\n                  This chemical is just sand. Silicon dioxide occurs naturally in foods, especially foods derived from plants.  Breathed in, silica dust can cause lung disease, even cancer.  For use in food, it is finely ground and added to salt and other foods to help powders flow more easily. Aluminium calcium silicate and tricalcium silicate are also used in foods, and calcium silicate is used in some dietary supplements.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZOIC ACID\r\n\r\n                  Preservative: Fruit juice, carbonated drinks, pickles.\r\n\r\n                  Preservative\r\n\r\n                  Manufacturers have used sodium benzoate (and its close relative benzoic acid) for a century to prevent the growth of microorganisms in acidic foods. The substances occur naturally in many plants and animals. They appear to be safe for most people, though they cause hives, asthma, or other allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. \r\n\r\n                  Another problem occurs when sodium benzoate is used in beverages that also contain ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The two substances, in an acidic solution, can react together to form small amounts of benzene, a chemical that causes leukemia and other cancers. Though the amounts of benzene that form are small, leading to only a very small risk of cancer, there is no need for consumers to experience any risk. In the early 1990s the FDA had urged companies not to use benzoate in products that also contain ascorbic acid, but in the 2000s companies were still using that combination. A lawsuit filed in 2006 by private attorneys ultimately forced Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and other soft-drink makers in the U.S. to reformulate affected beverages, typically fruit-flavored products.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SODIUM CARBOXYMETHYL CELLULOSE (CMC)\r\n\r\n                  Thickening and stabilizing agent, Prevents sugar from crystallizing: Ice cream, beer, pie fillings, icings, diet foods, candy.\r\n\r\n                  Thickening and stabilizing agent\r\n\r\n                  CMC is made by reacting cellulose with a derivative of acetic acid.

Sodium nitrate is used in dry cured meat, because it slowly breaks\r\n\r\n                    down into nitrite. Adding nitrite to food can lead to the formation of small amounts of\r\n\r\n                    potent cancer-causing chemicals (nitrosamines), particularly in fried bacon. Nitrite,\r\n\r\n                    which also occurs in saliva and forms from nitrate in several vegetables, can undergo the\r\n\r\n                    same chemical reaction in the stomach. Companies now add ascorbic acid or erythorbic acid\r\n\r\n                    to bacon to inhibit nitrosamine formation, a measure that has greatly reduced the problem.\r\n\r\n                    While nitrite and nitrate cause only a small risk, they are still worth avoiding.\r\n\r\n                  Several\r\n\r\n                    studies have linked consumption of cured meat and nitrite by children, pregnant women, and\r\n\r\n                    adults with various types of cancer. Although those studies have not yet proven that\r\n\r\n                    eating nitrite in bacon, sausage, and ham causes cancer in humans, pregnant women would be\r\n\r\n                    prudent to avoid those products.\r\n\r\n                  The meat industry justifies its use of nitrite and nitrate by claiming that it prevents\r\n\r\n                    the growth of bacteria that cause botulism poisoning. That’s true, but freezing and\r\n\r\n                    refrigeration could also do that, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has developed a\r\n\r\n                    safe method using lactic-acid-producing bacteria. The use of nitrite and nitrate has\r\n\r\n                    decreased greatly over the decades, because of refrigeration and restrictions on the\r\n\r\n                    amounts used. The meat industry could do the public’s health a favor by cutting back even\r\n\r\n                    further. Because nitrite is used primarily in fatty, salty foods, consumers have important nutritional reasons for avoiding nitrite-preserved foods. \r\n\r\n                  The labels on some \"natural\" hot dogs and other cured meats brag about \"no added nitrite.\"  Be skeptical.  While those products may not contain added sodium nitrite, they sometimes are made with celery powder or celery juice which are naturally high in nitrate.  A bacterial culture is used to convert that to nitrite. Indeed in 2011 the New York Times revealed that the \"natural\" cured meats could have 10 times as much nitrite as conventional products.  The bottom line: those products typically are high in salt and sometimes saturated fat, so they'd be worth eating only occasionally or avoiding entirely.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SODIUM STEAROYL FUMARATE\r\n\r\n                  See CALCIUM (or SODIUM) STEAROYL LACTYLATE\r\n\r\n                  Dough conditioner\r\n\r\n                   \r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SORBIC ACID, POTASSIUM SORBATE \r\n\r\n                  Prevents growth of mold: Cheese, syrup, jelly, cake, wine, dry fruits.\r\n\r\n                  Prevents growth of mold\r\n\r\n                  Sorbic acid occurs naturally in many plants.

It is now grown commercially in California, China, southeast Asia, and elsewhere. Stevia leaves are about 30 times as sweet as sugar, and contain sweet substances called steviol glycosides that are 200–300 times sweeter than sugar. Among the sweetest ones are rebaudioside A, also called reb A or rebiana, and stevioside. Companies are racing to market better-tasting extracts that have been dubbed rebaudioside D, M, X, and others.\r\n\r\nThe food industry and many consumers who are trying to avoid sugar and artificial sweeteners have high hopes for stevia leaf extracts. Crude stevia leaf extracts have long been used in Japan and several other countries. One flaw though, is that many people perceive stevia leaf and its sweet derivatives to have an unpleasant aftertaste, which companies are trying feverishly to overcome.\r\n\r\n                  In the 1990s, the FDA (and Canada and the European Union) rejected whole-leaf stevia and crude stevia extracts for use as a food ingredient. High dosages fed to rats reduced sperm production and increased cell proliferation in their testicles, which, at least at those dosages, could cause infertility or other problems. Pregnant hamsters that had been fed large amounts of a metabolite of stevioside called steviol had fewer and smaller offspring. In the laboratory, steviol can be converted into a mutagenic compound, which may promote cancer by causing mutations in the cells' DNA. FDA also was concerned that stevia might interfere with the absorption of carbohydrates and the conversion of food into energy within cells, as well as with effects on cardiovascular and renal systems.\r\n\r\n                  In the early 2000s, Cargill and Merisant (a marketer of sugar substitutes) developed highly purified extracts of stevia that are 95 percent pure rebaudioside A and 200 times as sweet as sugar. Since then, other companies have also developed highly purified extracts of stevia, some containing rebaudioside A and some containing stevioside. Truvia and Pure Via are the brand names for packaged or tabletop sweeteners containing mostly rebaudioside A, also called rebiana, and SweetLeaf is the brand name for packaged sweeteners containing both rebiana and stevioside. Like other packaged sugar substitutes, packets of those products contain only a very small amount of the actual high-intensity sweetener (rebiana and/or stevioside in this case), since the tiny bits of powder would get lost in the packets if a carrier were not added. Thus, Truvia packets are mostly erythritol, PureVia mostly dextrose and cellulose powder, and SweetLeaf mostly inulin.\r\n\r\n                  The one nagging concern (other than taste) about stevia leaf extracts is that they have not been adequately tested for cancer.  Several (but not all) genetic tests found that rebiana-related substances caused mutations and other forms of genotoxicity. Because such findings may indicate a cancer risk, that should have spurred the FDA to require additional animal feeding studies. Testing guidelines for widely used food additives generally call for two-year feeding studies in both rats and mice, but a sweetener (stevioside—a close relative of rebaudioside A) from stevia has been tested only in rats. Nevertheless, in late 2008 the FDA accepted rebaudioside A as \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) and in 2009 accepted extracts containing stevioside as well as rebiana as GRAS. In 2011 it accepted purified stevioside as GRAS. Companies quickly started marketing a wide range of lower-calorie, products sweetened with stevia leaf extracts, replacing some or all of the sugar or other high-potency sweeteners.\r\n\r\n                  Some food and beverage companies are trying to mask the aftertaste of rebiana with various ingredients, including ERYTHRITOL or modest amounts of sugar. Meanwhile, companies are developing other natural sweeteners, such as MONK FRUIT EXTRACT, MONATIN, and others. Ultimately, those substances might play an important role in reducing the harm caused by the huge amounts of SUGAR and HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP that so many people are consuming.\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SUCRALOSE\r\n\r\n                  Artificial sweetener: \"No sugar added,\" \"sugar-free,\" \"diet\" and other products, including baked goods, kettle corn, frozen desserts, ice cream, soft drinks, prepared meals, packaged (tabletop) sweeteners (Splenda).\r\n\r\n                  Artificial sweetener\r\n\r\n                  Approved in the United States in 1998, sucralose—sometimes marketed as Splenda—is used in soft drinks, baked goods, ice cream, and other products, including ones you might not expect, such as frozen dinners and English muffins. It is widely used around the world. Unlike aspartame, sucralose does not break down at high temperatures and so can be used in baked goods.\r\n\r\nWhen sucralose was first being considered for approval by the FDA, the Center for Science in the Public Interest objected. A study in rats had indicated that the additive might cause premature shrinkage of the thymus gland, which is part of the immune system. However, a subsequent study did not find any problem. Likewise, studies designed to detect whether sucralose could cause cancer in lab animals did not find any problems.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the greatest cause for concern is that in 2012 an independent Italian laboratory announced (but as of mid-2014 had not yet published) a study that found that sucralose caused leukemia in mice that were exposed to it from before birth. That was the same lab that several years earlier published studies that found that aspartame caused cancers in rats and mice.\r\n\r\nA 2002 study in mice found that huge doses of sucralose caused DNA damage in mice, but numerous other genetic studies did not find any problems.\r\n\r\nSeveral researchers contend that sucralose negatively impacts the gut, including changes in beneficial bacteria and enzymes. That could have a range of consequences, including inflammatory bowel disease, how drugs and other chemicals are absorbed and metabolized by the body, and the regulation of body weight, possibly leading to obesity. For example, a 2008 study (funded by the sugar industry) reported that Splenda significantly reduced beneficial bacteria and had other effects in the gastrointestinal tract of rats that could affect the bioavailability of drugs. Unfortunately, the study was small and had other significant shortcomings. A 2012 study found a close correlation between changes in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in different regions around the world and the use of saccharin and sucralose. However, finding a correlation is a long way from demonstrating a cause-effect relationship. Meanwhile, people experiencing IBD or other GI symptoms could see if avoiding sucralose provides any relief. \r\n\r\nEven setting aside these concerns, young children could exceed the FDA's  \"acceptable daily intake\" for sucralose (5 mg/kg), especially given sucralose's popularity (more products containing sugar substitutes use sucralose than any other sweetener).  For example, a 6-year old child weighing 45 pounds would exceed the FDA limit by drinking two or three 12-ounce sodas containing the typical 40-60 mg of sucralose per can.\r\n\r\nA final point: McNeil Nutritionals long advertised Splenda as being \"made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar.\" That statement may be literally true, but is misleading, as the Sugar Association charged in a lawsuit. In fact, the sweetener is a synthetic chemical made by chemically reacting sugar (sucrose) with chlorine. (The mere fact that sucralose is synthetic does not make it unsafe.) The lawsuit was settled without any announcement of the terms, but McNeil has dropped that \"made from sugar\" slogan.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SUCROSE ACETATE ISOBUTYRATE\r\n\r\n                  Emulsifier: Citrus-flavored beverages, including \"energy,\" \"sport,\" and \"electrolyte\" drinks, as well as such alcoholic beverages as wine coolers, malt beverage coolers, and premixed cocktail products.\r\n\r\n                  Emulsifier\r\n\r\n                  Sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB), like brominated vegetable oil, is used primarily in citrus-flavored drinks to keep the flavor oils in suspension, giving them a cloudy appearance.  In January 2013 it was announced as a replacement for brominated vegetable oil (BVO) in Gatorade, following widespread consumer protest over BVO.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFDA has approved its use in non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages up to 300 ppm.  SAIB has been subjected to short- and long-term studies in laboratory animals and people, at high doses, with little, if any, evidence of harm.  It is also approved for use in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SUGAR (SUCROSE)\r\n\r\n                  Sweetener: Table sugar, sweetened foods.\r\n\r\n                  Sweetener\r\n\r\n                  Sucrose, ordinary table sugar, occurs naturally in fruit, sugar cane, and sugar beets. Industry produced 64 pounds of sugar per person in 2009.  That figure is down from 119 pounds per year around 1970, but the decrease has been more than made up for by increased use of high-fructose corn syrup and dextrose.  In 2009, industry produced a total of about 131 pounds of refined sugars per person, though because of waste and spoilage the average American actually consumed about 93 pounds of all refined sugars (almost two pounds per week).  That represents a 14-percent reduction from the 1999 high of 108 pounds.  That historic decline resulted largely from declining soft drink consumption (due partly to increased health concerns and to the popularity of bottled water).\r\n\r\n                  Sugar and sweetened foods may taste good and supply energy, but most people eat too much of them. Sugar, corn syrup, and other refined sweeteners make up 16 percent of the average diet, but provide no vitamins, minerals, or protein.  That means a person would have to get 100 percent of his or her nutrients from only 84 percent of his or her food.  And, of course, some people, especially teen-aged boys, consume as much as 25 percent of their calories from refined sugars.\r\n\r\n                  When sugar is digested, it breaks down into one fructose and one glucose molecule. Small amounts of fructose and glucose from fruits, vegetables, sugar, HFCS, or other sources are safe.  However, large amounts promote tooth decay and displace nutrient-rich foods with empty calories.  Furthermore, large amounts of glucose boost blood sugar levels and large amounts of fructose increase triglyceride (fat) levels and small, dense LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels in blood, and may thereby increase the risk of heart disease.  Also, recent studies show that consuming 25 percent of calories from fructose or HFCS (which is about half fructose) leads to more visceral (deep belly) fat or liver fat.  Those changes may increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease.  Finally, preliminary research suggests that large amounts of fructose may upset levels of such hormones as leptin and ghrelin, which regulate appetite, thereby contributing to weight gain and obesity.\r\n\r\n                  The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (America's basic nutrition policy), American Heart Association, and other health authorities recommend that people consume no more than about 3 to 8 percent of calories in the form of refined sugars.  That's far less than the current average of 16 percent of calories.  The bottom line: the less added sugars—fructose, sucrose, or HFCS—one consumes the better (though, again, small amounts are safe).\r\n\r\n                  Some companies have been replacing high-fructose corn syrup  with sugar, pretending that that makes their products more healthful.  In fact, there's essentially no nutritional  difference between sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, so just ignore the  marketing hype.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  SULFITES (SULFUR DIOXIDE, SODIUM BISULFITE)\r\n\r\n                  Preservative, bleach: Dried fruit, wine, processed potatoes.\r\n\r\n                  Preservative, bleach\r\n\r\n                  Sulfiting agents prevent discoloration (dried fruit, some \"fresh\" shrimp, and some dried, fried, or frozen potatoes) and bacterial growth (wine). They also destroy vitamin B-1 and, most important, can cause severe reactions, especially in asthmatics. To non-sensitive individuals, sulfites are safe.  If you think you may be sensitive, avoid all forms of this additive, because it caused at least twelve identifiable deaths in the 1980s and probably many, many more in the preceding decades.  Deaths and less severe reactions were linked most commonly to restaurants foods.  Sulfite levels in the lettuce and potatoes served at restaurants were often extremely high, because workers would allow the vegetable to sit in a sulfite solution for far too long a time.  As a result of pressure from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a congressional hearing, and media attention, the FDA banned the most dangerous uses of sulfites and required that wine labels list sulfite, when used.  Since those actions, CSPI has not been aware of any additional deaths.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  TAGATOSE\r\n\r\n                  Sugar Substitute: Breakfast cereals, cereal bars, diet and non-diet soft drinks, jelly, pudding, meal replacement drink mix, coffee mix powder, candy, chewing gum.\r\n\r\n                  Sugar substitute\r\n\r\n                  This relatively new additive is chemically related to (the mirror image of) fructose, but is poorly absorbed by the body. That's why it yields only about one-third as many calories and why large amounts cause diarrhea, nausea, and flatulence. In one study, 20 grams (about five teaspoons) caused nausea. Tagatose does not promote tooth decay. It is nearly (92 percent) as sweet as sugar. It is found at low levels in apples, pineapples, oranges, raisins, dates, heated cow’s milk, and other foods.\r\n\r\n                "," \r\n\r\n                  TARTARIC ACID, POTASSIUM ACID TARTRATE, SODIUM POTASSIUM TARTRATE, SODIUM TARTRATE \r\n\r\n                  Antioxidant: Beverages, candy, ice cream, baked goods, yogurt, gelatin desserts, baking powder.\r\n\r\n                  Antioxidant\r\n\r\n                  Tartaric acid occurs naturally in grapes, other fruits, and coffee beans.

Although approved as a sweetener in Europe, Australia/New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, and a number of other countries, you won't find it at the store or listed on food labels in the United States. That's because it has not been approved as a sweetener in the United States, although it has been designated \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) as a flavor modifier.  Like rebiana and mogrosides, other natural, high-potency sweeteners, it is said to have a \"licorice-like\" aftertaste, which consumers may find distasteful and might be the reason it is rarely used.

People who believe they are sensitive to MSG might try to avoid foods containing Torula, but there have not been any studies testing Torula for MSG-type reactions.

Transglutaminase is a naturally occurring enzyme that is presumably safe, but used to deceive consumers.  Also, because binding two pieces of food together puts into the protected center of meat or seafood any bacteria that were on the outside of a piece and, hence, easily killed in cooking.
